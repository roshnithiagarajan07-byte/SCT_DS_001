# SCT_DS_001
## 📊 Population Distribution Visualization
📌 Task Overview
This project demonstrates how to visualize population data using a bar chart. The visualization represents the distribution of population across different age groups, helping to understand demographic patterns clearly.

## 📂 Dataset Used
Sample population data (in millions):
Age Group
Population
0–20
512
21–40
807
41–60
399
61+
86

## 📈 Visualization Type
Bar Chart
Suitable for categorical data like age groups.
Created using Python (Matplotlib).

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python
Google Colab
Matplotlib
GitHub
## 📷 Output
The output is a clear bar chart image showing population distribution by age group.
This image can be used for reports, presentations, or academic submissions.

## 🎯 Objective
To understand how data visualization helps in:
Comparing population across age categories
Identifying demographic trends
Presenting data in an easy-to-understand visual format

## ✅ Conclusion
Bar charts are an effective way to represent categorical data visually. This task successfully demonstrates basic data visualization techniques using Python.
